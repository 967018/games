### General FAQs about FGI

- I found problem in pages or link failure

	Welcome [participate in FGI contributions](https://github.com/FurryGamesIndex/games/blob/master/doc/Contribute.en.md)

- "Search" function seems to have a problem

	There is only the most basic search tag function, and only one tag can be searched at a time, and the full name of the tag must be used, such as `male:wolf`, `type:visual-novel`, etc.

	The goal is that multiple tags can be searched at the same time, and multiple tags can be excluded. For example, "Search for main characters including canine furries and the type is a visual novel, but not include games that's author is "Studio Klondike""

	It is worth mentioning that, now you can also quickly enter the search page by clicking the tag in the game page.

	For example, This is the search address for all games of The Echo Project: https://furrygamesindex.github.io/zh-cn/search.html?tag?author:The%20Echo%20Project

	Many games currently lack tags, so they may not be displayed when searching for some normal tags searching. These games with missing tags can be listed by searching `sys:tagme`, which may help to help friends who want to contribute tags find the games to contribute more easily: https://furrygamesindex.github.io/zh-cn/search. html?tag?sys:tagme

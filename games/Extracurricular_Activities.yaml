  Extracurricular Activities is a visual novel following the main character (you!) through his endeavor of trying to romance a member of his tennis team. The choices you make can impact the way you teammates react to you, so make your choices carefully.

  Currently, there are five dateable characters, and I hope to add more down the line.

  The writing and programming are all done by myself.  The background art is done by [Gavel](http://twitter.com/Gavelly)!

  We have a new Artist on board to take over the character art, and that would be CaptainGerBear. You can check him out on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/Captaingerbear), [FurAffinity](http://www.furaffinity.net/user/captaingerbear/), or his [website](http://townseed.ca/bigfingers/).  He's made the popular games [Bastard Bonds](http://store.steampowered.com/app/486720/Bastard_Bonds/) and See No Evil!
  
  CursedMarked and I have split for personal reasons and cannot pursue a professional relationship any longer.  We came to the agreement that it's best that we no longer work together.  This is not something that is up for discussion.

  Please, don't ask when I'm updating the guides either.  The guides are low priority for me, and the time spent updating them is better spent towards adding new content.

  IMPORTANT!
  
  Please, read my FAQ before asking questions about the visual novel also.  It can be found [here](http://docs.google.com/document/d/1ONtvrqyZA52yAGp3K20VWXd3Myviamwcaj2XKshFpnY/edit?usp=sharing).  
  
  It is still a work in progress.

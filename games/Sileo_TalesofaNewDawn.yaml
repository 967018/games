  Sileo: Tales of a New Dawn is a brand new gay furry visual novel currently in development. Escape your old life and start anew in the idyllic mountain town of Woodcrest. Reunite with an old flame, make new friends, begin a new career and perhaps even find love? Play through multiple unique novel-length storylines in which you'll overcome great obstacles, meet a litany of colorful characters and perhaps even fall in love with the man of your dreams!

  Our team has been working tirelessly these past few months preparing to debut our first demo and at long last, the day is finally here! We're incredibly proud of what we've created so far, but this is only the beginning! Going forward, we'll be working to both improve upon what we already have as well as add new content and features and finally tell the stories I've been waiting 8 long years to tell. 

  If you like what you see, be sure to [support us on Patreon](http://patreon.com/werecat) to get monthly development builds, behind the scenes updates, hi-resolution artwork and more! We'd really appreciate your support!

  We will release new builds of Sileo each month. Patreon will receive new content one month ahead of the Itch builds, however bug fixes and other improvements will be identical between versions where applicable. Be sure to [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/WerecatEnt) to keep up to date with what's coming!

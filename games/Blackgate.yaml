  Blackgate is a mature visual novel of a mostly M/M nature. While there will be a limited number of scenes of a M/F nature, the game is intended to be mostly M/M. The game also contains elements of horror, violence, and some gore (separate from the sexual scenes). Prepare to hate everyone, and everything.

  Who works on the game and where can I find them?

name: Killigan's Treasure

description: |
  Set in the land of Canavar, you play as a bull-like barbarian named Killigan Stoneworth, determined to follow an enchanted treasure map throughout the world. He meets several companions along the way that join him in his quest for unimaginable riches, and who can become more than companions, if you wish.
  Killigan's Treasure follows an overarching plot at heart, but you CAN choose to pursue a relationship with certain companions (All relationships are currently M/M). Each of them has their own backstory and events that tie back into the overarching plot, so you don't miss out on any story-critical information just for pining after a boyfriend.
  Deep in development, will be a work in progress for a while to come. Beware, it's mature content and only for people ages 18 and up!

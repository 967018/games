  Socially Awkward is a 18+ semi-linear furry visual novel focusing on emotional cues to portray the story of each individual character on certain topics and reactions.

  You are Jayce (Name can be replaced). An insecure half breed cat who just started his college life. Follow his college days to uncover each characters' past to get to know them.

  THE GAME IS STILL A W.I.P.

  # A World at Peace:
  Perhaps you are used to fairy tales and legends of heroes who journey to far off lands to defeat a great evil who threatens the peace of the world. But what you will quickly find in this story is no such thing. For you see the world is already very much at peace. There may be a few bandits lying in wait on the high roads, thieves who break into homes in the dead of knight, and pick pockets and extortionists prowling the city streets; But there are no wars, very few famines, and certainly no evil sorcerers to stop . It couldn't be a more perfect time to be alive, especially for our young prince, who is about to come of age and soon be rightfully chosen to lead his nation. He has suffered from few plights, and rides on the coattails of his father's success. But all good things must come to an end. Underneath this peaceful world there is a bubbling mire of conspiracy that seeks to drown our prince. With the assistance of those known as Kingsguard, selected individuals to serve as the bodyguards of the royal family, the prince who soon be forced to flee his home to escape those who would wish to end his life,  to travel this unknown world that he has only ever read about in books. His journey will be long and perilous This is no dream come true nor an adventure anyone would wish for. But it is one that he has no choice but to see it through to the end.

  # What can you expect?
  Kingsguard is considered a non-linear visual novel so your choices will bring about changes to the story, open up new dialogue, and even affect the ending. To fully understand the story and piece together the mysteries the characters will face, you must play each of the three character paths that will take you to a different corner of Torvair. The choices you make will have consequences and effect the story in various ways. 

  # Kudos:
  The current sprite artist is TheBigSlick, who has supplied my with some amazing sprites for the three main characters and will be making more as I continue to work on the game. He has both a [twitter](https://twitter.com/TBS_thebigslick) and a [furaffinity](http://www.furaffinity.net/user/thebigslick/) page where you can check out his work.

  I also have a cg artist, SunShtein who is helping supply art at various significant moments in the game. He has a [furaffinity](http://www.furaffinity.net/user/sunshtein) where you can take a look as his gallery.

  Lastly RULER has been kind to supply me with some temporary sprites as placeholders until TheBigSlick creates the official ones. You can check him out here at his [twitter](https://twitter.com/RLEROFEVRYTHING).

  # Updates:
  This game still has much work to be done, and updates to the game happen every few months, but regardless I pour my heart into every build, hoping to make this story one of a kind. With your support I will be able to provide you with a compelling story, memorable characters, great artwork, and hopefully a dark yet thrilling experience. 

  Currently, the most recent update is available on my Patreon for supporters. The most recent build will be available for download in 2 weeks time. Subsequent updates will then be only available for Patreons until enough updates have passed.

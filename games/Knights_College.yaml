  Knights College is an adult kemono visual novel set in a dormitory where elite knights-in-training live.
  In this game, the cards the main character collects as he lives in the dormitory will present all possible choices.

  Knights College will be released on Steam.

  One day, Argo, a young man who lives in a rural fishing village, receives an admission letter to a place he never expected.
  It is the Knights Training Organization’s “Knights College”, a place only those of noble blood lines and high status are allowed to enter.
  Argo, who is just a commoner, was admitted because he has a special ability called “Cardification” sleeping within him.
  As he lives in the elite knight’s dormitory, Argo will learn to use his ability and eventually become entangled in a certain event.
